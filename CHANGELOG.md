- Default user profile URL changed to `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo`
from `https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/people/me`.  This migrates from Google+
Sign-in to Google Sign-in (not Google+), as necessitated by the [Google+ API
shutdown](https://developers.google.com/+/api-shutdown).
